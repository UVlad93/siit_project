# siit_project
My Django Project for SIIT

This Django project is meant to provide a website that serves as a training diary for climbers.
It features CRUD operations for diary entries, and it allows users to log testing sessions for which they can
get a graph tracking their evolution over time.

The project will be expanded in the future with added functionality aimed at climbers' needs.
